These elements can include patterns, decorative elements, or motifs that serve to enhance or complement the main focus of the graffiti. Backgrounds in graffiti are not about the priming of the area that will be covered by the creation of a graffito but rather focus on the elements that are in the background of the graffito. They provide a context and aesthetic framework that can influence the overall perception and interpretation of the graffiti. It's important to note that these backgrounds are not merely passive or incidental; they are often carefully considered and executed to contribute to the overall impact of the graffiti.",

This term serves as an umbrella for a wide range of subcategories, including 'street art', 'graffiti symbols', 'graffiti writings', and 'verbal graffiti', each with its own unique characteristics and cultural implications. Graffiti is often associated with the act of marking or altering a space without permission, typically in urban environments. It is a form of expression that transcends traditional boundaries, both physical and societal, to communicate a message, mark territory, or simply exist as a visual element within the graffiti-scape.\nWhile the forms and styles of graffiti can vary greatly, they all share a common purpose: to make a statement, to communicate, and to exist within the public eye. Despite its often transient nature, graffiti plays a significant role in shaping the visual and cultural landscape of our urban environments.",

This motif can be incorporated into a graffito in various ways, from standalone designs to patterns, and even as a stylistic element in lettering.\nThe heart motif can be used to convey a range of messages or sentiments, depending on its context within the graffiti. It can express personal feelings, comment on societal issues related to love and relationships, or simply serve as a decorative element. In some instances, graffitists may also shape letters or entire words into a heart form, adding a layer of visual interest and complexity to their work. ",

Firstly, a memorial can be a graffito created specifically to remember or honour an individual. This is similar to a dedication, where the graffito serves as a tribute to a person, often someone who has passed away or is greatly respected within the community. Secondly, a memorial can also refer to a graffito that is actively preserved by the community in memory of a graffitist who has passed away, particularly if they died prematurely. In this case, the graffito itself becomes a symbol of remembrance, a testament to the graffitist's impact on the community and their contribution to the graffiti-scape. \nIt's important to note that the purpose of a graffito can change over time. A work that was not initially created as a memorial may become one of the graffitist it's associated with passes away. Similarly, a memorial graffito may gain new layers of meaning as it is preserved and interacted with by the community over time.",

Firstly, it can refer to a specific part of the graffito that is intended to communicate a direct message to a particular audience. This could be a fellow graffitist, a graffiti crew, or the general public. These messages can be explicit, such as a dedication or a statement, or they can be more subtle, requiring knowledge of the graffiti community's codes and conventions to understand.\nSecondly, the term \"message\" can also refer to the overall meaning or statement that the graffito as a whole is intended to convey. This could be a political statement, a social commentary, or an expression of the graffitist's identity or emotions. The interpretation of this message can vary greatly depending on the viewer's perspective and context. For example, the creator of the graffito may have a specific intention or message in mind, but this may be interpreted differently by an observer or a researcher studying the graffiti.",

This stencil is then used as a guide to apply paint onto a surface, creating a reproducible and precise image. This technique is particularly popular in graffiti due to its simplicity, speed, and ability to create identical symbols, letters, or shapes.\nIn the context of graffiti, the paint stencil technique is often used to create a specific type of graffiti known as stencil graffiti. This form of graffiti is characterized by its sharp, well-defined images that can be quickly and easily reproduced, making it a popular choice for graffitists who want to disseminate their work widely and rapidly. Moreover, the paint stencil technique allows for a high degree of creativity. Graffitists can use multiple layers of paint or aerosol to create the illusion of depth, and the stencils themselves can range from simple to complex designs. This flexibility, combined with the technique's inherent speed and reproducibility, has made the paint stencil technique a mainstay in the world of graffiti.",

Photorealism originated as an art movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where artists would study a photograph and then attempt to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. In the context of graffiti, the photorealistic style is often used to create intricate and lifelike representations of people, objects, or scenes on walls or other large surfaces. The photorealistic style requires a high level of technical skill and artistic prowess, as it involves accurately capturing the minute details, textures, lighting, and colours of the subject matter.

However, within the graffiti community, the style and uniqueness of a tag can be a source of respect and recognition. A well-executed tag can demonstrate a graffitist's skill, creativity, and individuality.\nTagging is often associated with the act of \"bombing\", where a graffitist aims to create as many tags as possible in a single outing, covering a large area or highly visible locations.

This movement is characterised by its focus on text-based graffiti, often involving the use of stylised lettering and tags.

It incorporates not only the physical act of creating text-based graffiti but also the intangible aspects such as the culture, ethos, and community that surround this practice.\nKey elements of the writing movement include styles, pieces, and tags. Styles refer to the unique lettering designs used by graffitists, pieces are larger and more complex works often involving multiple colours and intricate designs, and tags are the simplest form of graffiti, usually consisting of the graffitist's chosen name or signature.\nWhile the writing movement has its roots in the US, it has since spread globally, influencing graffiti practices and cultures around the world.
