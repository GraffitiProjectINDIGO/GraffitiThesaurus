These signs can appear as standalone motifs on a surface, or they may be incorporated into a larger composition, often in conjunction with text, messages, or slogans.
The use of gender signs in graffiti serves various purposes. They can be used to express the graffitist's own gender identity, comment on societal norms and expectations related to gender, or convey a specific message or statement about gender issues. The interpretation of these signs can depend on their context within the graffiti, as well as the cultural and societal norms of the viewer.
Despite their simplicity, gender signs can be powerful symbols within the graffiti landscape.

This style is characterised by its use of precise lines, angles, and shapes, which lend a sense of order and symmetry to the graffiti.
In the geometric style, letters are often deconstructed into their basic geometric components, such as squares, circles, and triangles. These elements are then reassembled or overlaid in a way that maintains the legibility of the letters while introducing a distinct visual complexity.
The geometric style is a testament to the graffitist's ability to manipulate and reinterpret traditional letter forms.

This is similar to a dedication, where the graffito serves as a tribute to a person, often someone who has passed away or is greatly respected within the community. Secondly, a memorial can also refer to a graffito that is actively preserved by the community in memory of a graffitist who has passed away, particularly if they died prematurely. In this case, the graffito itself becomes a symbol of remembrance, a testament to the graffitist's impact on the community and their contribution to the graffiti-scape. 
It's important to note that the purpose of a graffito can change over time. A work that was not initially created as a memorial may become one of the graffitist it's associated with passes away. Similarly, a memorial graffito may gain new layers of meaning as it is preserved and interacted with by the community over time."

These messages can be explicit, such as a dedication or a statement, or they can be more subtle, requiring knowledge of the graffiti community's codes and conventions to understand.
Secondly, the term ""message"" can also refer to the overall meaning or statement that the graffito as a whole is intended to convey. This could be a political statement, a social commentary, or an expression of the graffitist's identity or emotions. The interpretation of this message can vary greatly depending on the viewer's perspective and context.

In graffiti, swirls can be used in a variety of ways. They can serve as a background or filler, adding depth and complexity to a piece. They can also be used to outline or highlight other elements of the design, or they can stand alone as a focal point.

taggingTechnique	concept	tagging (technique)	surfaceCoveringProcessesAndTechniquesGT	Concept	activity	tagging $$ tagging (activity)	"""Tagging"" is a technique employed by graffitists to create a specific type of graffiti known as a ""tag"". This technique involves the use of a quick, stylised script or signature, often created with a marker or spray paint. The tag serves as a pseudonymous signature or logo for the graffitist, allowing them to mark their presence in a particular location without revealing their true identity. The act of tagging is often seen as one of the most basic forms of graffiti, both in terms of the skill level required and the simplicity of the resulting mark. However, within the graffiti community, the style and uniqueness of a tag can be a source of respect and recognition. A well-executed tag can demonstrate a graffitist's skill, creativity, and individuality.
Tagging is often associated with the act of ""bombing"", where a graffitist aims to create as many tags as possible in a single outing, covering a large area or highly visible locations. This can be seen as a form of territorial marking or a way for the graffitist to gain recognition and ""get up"" in the graffiti community."	Jona Schlegel $$ Stefan Worgin

Tags are usually created quickly and can be found in a variety of locations throughout urban environments. They are often used by graffitists to mark territory, gain recognition, or participate in the broader graffiti community.

The primary purpose of a throw up is not to demonstrate artistic skill or to create a visually complex piece, but rather to quickly mark a large area with the graffitist's handstyle or moniker.
