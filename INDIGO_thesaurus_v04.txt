These walls often feature interconnected graffiti that collectively express a specific concept or narrative. Concept walls can be seen as visual storytelling, where each graffito contributes to the overall message or theme. The concept could be anything from a social or political commentary, a depiction of a particular event or person, or an abstract idea expressed through visual metaphors. Creating a concept wall requires planning and coordination, especially when multiple graffitists are involved.

Visually, connections can be created through the use of lines, shapes, colours, and patterns that link different parts of the graffito together. For example, a graffitist might use a consistent colour scheme or recurring motifs to create a sense of unity and cohesion within their work. Similarly, the letters in a piece of graffiti writing might be interconnected or overlapped in a way that creates a visual flow and rhythm.
Conceptually, connections can be established through the use of shared themes, symbols, or references.

This excess paint then drips down the surface, creating streaks that can disrupt the intended design of the graffito.
While some experienced graffitists may intentionally incorporate drips into their work as a stylistic choice, unintentional drips are generally seen as a sign of inexperience.

Secondly, a memorial can also refer to a graffito that is actively preserved by the community in memory of a graffitist who has passed away, particularly if they died prematurely.

This stencil is then used as a guide to apply paint onto a surface, creating a reproducible and precise image. This technique is particularly popular in graffiti due to its simplicity, speed, and ability to create identical symbols, letters, or shapes.
In the context of graffiti, the paint stencil technique is often used to create a specific type of graffiti known as stencil graffiti. This form of graffiti is characterized by its sharp, well-defined images that can be quickly and easily reproduced, making it a popular choice for graffitists who want to disseminate their work widely and rapidly. Moreover, the paint stencil technique allows for a high degree of creativity. Graffitists can use multiple layers of paint or aerosol to create the illusion of depth, and the stencils themselves can range from simple to complex designs. This flexibility, combined with the technique's inherent speed and reproducibility, has made the paint stencil technique a mainstay in the world of graffiti."

This style is often associated with street art and art itself, as it involves drawing something that looks as realistic as a picture or photograph. Photorealism originated as an art movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where artists would study a photograph and then attempt to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. In the context of graffiti, the photorealistic style is often used to create intricate and lifelike representations of people, objects, or scenes on walls or other large surfaces. The photorealistic style requires a high level of technical skill and artistic prowess, as it involves accurately capturing the minute details, textures, lighting, and colours of the subject matter.

The role of a writer extends beyond the physical act of creating graffiti. Writers are also participants in the graffiti culture, using their work to communicate with their peers, mark territory, and express their individuality. They contribute to the richness and diversity of the graffiti-scape, each bringing their unique style and perspective to the medium."	Jona Schlegel $$ Stefan Worgin											writersGraffiti

This movement is characterised by its focus on text-based graffiti, often involving the use of stylised lettering and tags. The writing movement is more than just a type of graffito; it represents a cultural phenomenon that has had a significant impact on the evolution of the graffiti-scape. It incorporates not only the physical act of creating text-based graffiti but also the intangible aspects such as the culture, ethos, and community that surround this practice.
Key elements of the writing movement include styles, pieces, and tags. Styles refer to the unique lettering designs used by graffitists, pieces are larger and more complex works often involving multiple colours and intricate designs, and tags are the simplest form of graffiti, usually consisting of the graffitist's chosen name or signature.
While the writing movement has its roots in the US, it has since spread globally, influencing graffiti practices and cultures around the world. It underscores the power of graffiti as a form of communication and expression, and its capacity to transcend geographical and cultural boundaries."
